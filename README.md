# AIRENT
Airent allows users to rent out everything they want in trusted groups. Users can create groups, join groups, and post their items in the groups. A group creator can assign other members as group managers who have the power to manage group passcode and kick unbehaved members out of the group.

# MVP Goals
Users will be able to:
- create a new account
- sign in/out of existing account
- create/join groups
- post items with title, description, price and a image.
- read item details and group details
- delete posts they own
- delete the groups they created
- send rental requests, approve rental requests, and confirm return
